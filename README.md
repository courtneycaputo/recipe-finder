# Recipe Finder

## About the Project
We wanted to create a website that would help inspire people what to cook with ingredients they already have in their fridge. When an ingredient is searched, 3 recipes will appear for the user to choose from. Once a recipe is chosen, the recipe ingredients and instructions are shown, along with a random cocktail to pair with your meal.
